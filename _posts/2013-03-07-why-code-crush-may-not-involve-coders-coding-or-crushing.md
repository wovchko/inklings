Nashville is fortunate that it has a handful of talented people who act as a bridge between the business and technical communities.  I feel privileged that some of my peers have begun counting me as part of that circle.  Compared to most others in our nerdy fraternity, I'm among the lessor known.  I suppose a big part of the reason I lack public luster is because of a decision I made during my first start-up in 1999.   I try my best to endear myself to the technical community as opposed to promoting myself among the finance community.  I enjoy a role as a connector and facilitator among my fellow geeks and have never regretted the decisions that have resulted in my lack of access to the cigar lounges of the finance community.

This evening, I'm choosing to uncharacteristically step out and publicly challenge the technical community and finance community toward swift change and a commitment to communicate.

This late-night post comes on the heals of a flurry of back channel communication within the technology community all day.  Even into the late evening, emails among groups of influencers in the technology community are being traded at a steady cadence and the tone of frustration is not dissipating.

The hoopla to which I’m referring emerged from an article posted to Southern Alpha regarding a collaborative initiative between the Entrepreneur's Center and Microsoft called Code Crush 2013.  Code Crush is seeking to support three for-profit start-ups by appealing to the technology community to offer free labor.  Code Crush is also taking on corporate sponsorships to subsidize the costs of the event.

One more time — this time in slow motion.  The money guys are seeking free labor from the technology guys to kickstart three for-profit companies with no promise of upside for those providing the free labor.

One last time — as simple as I can make it. Rich guys ask middle class guys to do free work.

By my measure, Code Crush isn’t really the exclusive source of the digital blaze that my phone has been suffering from all day.  Code Crush is the latest in a series of events that the financial community has attempted to organize to stimulate the technical community’s involvement in initiatives backed by Entrepreneur's Center, Nashville Technology Council, and Nashville’s Chamber of Commerce.

##### There are a few consistent themes I’ve lifted from today’s email threads.  If the financial community wants engagement with the entrepreneurial segment of the technology community...
- Why aren’t they engaging the informal circle of influencers who can help them shape their ideas into propositions the technical community will embrace?
- Why are they asking for free labor without being clear about the scope, ongoing commitment, risks, IP assignments, and potential rewards?
- Why ask for free help in creating a commercial endeavor when the extremely successful not-for-profit events the technical community has self-organized have gone unsupported?
- Why haven’t they engaged the leadership that has successfully produced events twice the size and has a built-in, proven following?

I’ve got a ton of respect for all the parties involved.  So in the spirit of being constructive, I’m going to offer some general feedback to the broad business community on how to best earn the ear of the technical community.  After all, we all have aligned interests.  We love Nashville, believe in the incredible potential that exists here, and understand that working together is an absolute necessity to transform Nashville into a vibrant start-up culture.

Before I deep-dive into my best attempt at representing my peers, let me first share a few of my personal beliefs.  

I love the leadership that a small number of members in the financial community have demonstrated in recent years.  If not for the daily leadership of Michael Burcham, I sincerely believe that the start-up scene in Nashville would be just as dead today as it was in the midst of the dot-com boom when I fell off the turnip truck in SoBro 14 years ago.  Vic Gato and Townes Duncan were the earliest of the trailblazers willing to take significant reputation risks by leveraging cash on very non-traditional endeavors through Jumpstart Foundry and Solidus Academy.

The issue isn’t high caliber people — we have that.  The issue is communication.  

I’ve observed tension between the financial and technical communities for a long time.  Wait, let’s broaden that.  It’s the business community and craftsman community (designers, engineers, SEO, writers, etc).

The members of the design community who participate in the615 have been getting antsy since 2000 whenever well-intentioned business people posted an “opportunity” to the group to win the privilege of re-branding their company by means of a “design contest”.  I’ve observed the615 community up-in-arms when the Technology Council allegedly used tax dollars to outsource design work offshore.  I’ve seen the technical community react so negatively to initiatives like the User Group Roundtable and Platform Showdown that they were cancelled.  Further, the community of craftsman never show-up in a noticeable way to support events like Spark Nashville or G4E Nashville.

How many more failures are we going to have before we begin to understand that we need to talk to each other before issuing press releases?

Are these craftsman unappeasable or is there an identifiable, common thread why the events facilitated by the business community get very little support?  Conversely, why are “hack day” events cropping-up left and right to meet the high demand of hundreds of attendees? Why has Nashville Software School reached a near fever-pitch of praise among craftsman?

To borrow a phrase from my C-suite handbook, let’s “unpack” this a bit.

If you’ve never visited, I’m about to bring you into the inner sanctum of the craftsman psyche — and unveil the value systems by which my peers live.  If you are a member of the business community, understanding and embracing these values will significantly improve your probability of success in communicating with craftsman.

__They Don’t Know You.__  Keep in mind, craftsman focus on an entirely different spectrum of information.  Just because you’ve had some wins in business doesn’t mean the craftsman knows who you are or believes in your ability to delivery on your promises.

__Perception.__  Craftsman understand that the Entrepreneur’s Center is not a direct investment vehicle.  They also understand that the stated purpose of the EC is to facilitate the creation of investable stories.  The implicit take-away from this brand promise is that a start-up who pays for and completes the EC’s program to produce an investible story has higher probability of acquiring investment dollars.  If the stated purpose of the EC is to value Story over Product, why would a craftsman support an organization which devalues the importance of his work?

__Aiming Before Firing.__  In 14 years of being an open source leader in Nashville my phone has only been rung one time by one person requesting advice on how to rally the support of the craftsman community.  I’d name him, but then again, he’s only called once.  So although I appreciate the call, naming him wouldn’t do him any favors.  This experience isn’t isolated to just me.  So any personality disorder I may or may not have can’t possibly be the source of the lack of collaboration.  To my knowledge, no member of the craftsman community who facilitates a meet-up group or hosts craftsman-centered events are included in brainstorming or planning.  Further, it’s my personal experience that emails to these groups go unanswered.  Speaking confidently on the behalf of my peers, we would be over the moon if given the opportunity to collaborate and help shape ideas.  We have circles of influence that we would activate in a heartbeat if we were included in discussions prior to public announcements.

__If you have time to get 9 sponsors.__  Pretty self explanatory.  If there was time to attract 9 sponsors to this event, there was time to have a couple phone calls with community leaders.

__MVP, LOI, Build, Collect (repeat).__Craftsman want to know that an idea can stand on it’s own two feet when it’s manifested into a working product.  If the objective is to get a craftsman engaged in an idea, demonstrate that prospective customers are ready to pay for a delivered product.  Demonstrate that these prospective customers have a crystal-clear understanding of exactly what they expect to be delivered with a simple artifact like a paper prototype of a Minimum Viable Product.  Don’t ask craftsman to build anything beyond the MVP until the LOI’s are delivered.

__Language.__  Recognize that people travel in herds.  Craftsman like working with other craftsman.  If you aren’t a craftsman and you need the help of a craftsman, you would be wise to learn what’s important to them and how to speak their language.  Remember that you are the one asking for free labor.

__Time Boxing & Upside.__  There is a sliding bar that craftsman subconsciously use when considering investing their time in a start-up.  If you are limited in the equity you can offer, offer to time box the craftsman’s commitment.  Limiting the time aspect of exposure to risk is a major component in the decision of a craftsman.

__Don’t Be Crazy.__  If you are considering rewarding the craftsman who builds the foundation atop which your entire business is built 5% in common stock, which vests over 18 months, at the pre-revenue stage, with no constraints on the time investment required, and without a professional product plan — you are straight-up nuts.  So for anyone who thinks an iPad Mini is a good reward...

__Estimating & Planning.__  Become a student of the process of developing software, particularly estimating and planning.

__Light Tech.__  Light Tech is a phrase used to describe events that were originally established to encourage discussions about technical innovation and exposing aspiring technologists to experienced peers who can help them get started.  Many of these events are so heavily attended by marketers and recruiters that their plots have been lost.  If you want meaningful innovation, it’s okay to constrain the group allowed to participate in an event.

__We Are Not I.T.__  There is a difference between information technology professionals and product developers.  This is not a small nuance.  Both skill sets are incredibly important — and radically different.  Accountants and lawyer both spend a lot of time using Microsoft Office but that doesn’t make their roles interchangeable.  It’s important you understand the distinction.

__Confusing Effort and Results.__  Craftsman hate mixers.  We love building product.  Networking is what happens between two people who are experiencing eye spasms from prolonged exposure to a computer screen.  If you want innovation, stop making mixers the pillar of social interaction at events.

__The Stack Matters.__  Using innovative tools in the development of your product matters.  If craftsman wanted to spend more time working on outdated, boring stuff, they’d spend extra time at their day job.

__Stop Backing Horrible Ideas.__  This one is important.  Craftsman are paying attention to the money that the finance community is putting into start-ups.  Seriously, 90% would still be horrible ideas if they were executed flawlessly.  It would be good to include actual product developers and marketers in the selection of companies who get selected into local incubation programs.

##### In conclusion, I’m recommending a number of calls to action for my respected colleagues in the finance community who are seeking to align great ideas with great craftsman:
- Let’s get serious about communicating with one another.
- Understand who the community leaders are and engage them
- Support the organic efforts of craftsman instead of creating something new
- Offer real rewards
