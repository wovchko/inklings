title: "Early Scrum Health Check"
description: "Only three iterations into adopting Agile/Scrum at a Fortune 50 company, I'm asked by a friend to help evaluate if the training his team of ~75 has received is successfully translating into the adoption of the core tenets of Agile/Scrum.  A difficult question to answer without knowing the teams, I offer a list of questions for my friend to use while conducting a post-mortem on training and his teams perspective on their progress to date."

I had dinner this evening with a successful technology leader for which I've always had a lot of respect — I count him as a friend.  Over recent years he's progressively moved into more business oriented roles.  He's a super smart guy and although he'd never admit to it, I'm reasonably sure he could still create a web app in a weekend if he felt the need.  By my measuring stick, these are key ingredients to a fair and objective leader in software development.  My friend is working inside a Fortune 50 company leading a large initiative which has a lot of visibility at the top-levels of the company.  He's found in the past year that his team of ~75 developers is feeling the pressure of deadlines and is falling short in the areas of transparency, estimation, planning, and delivery.  You know, aside from a strong commitment to craftsmanship, the most important stuff.

My friend has a lot of influence on business-level decisions but is limited in his ability to influence how the engineering organization chooses to commit to and execute work.  In my view, this is the classic disadvantage of organizing people by departments and not disciplines.  After some encouragement, the engineering organization agreed to hire an Agile/Scrum consultant to provide training to the team.  Although my friend has been advocating the adoption of an Agile methodology, he's also quick to admit he moved into a business role before Scrum went mainstream — so he was hoping I could help him find a way to benchmark progress in a fair way.

He asked a simple question, "How do I know the training is working?".  Loaded question.  There is a lot I don't know.   Finding a way to answer this question is less of an exercise about whether the team is pro- or anti-Scrum.  It's more about understanding if the trainer was effective, the material was absorbed by the team, and if the lack of follow-up coaching presented a problem in the team's ability to self-organize.

Near the conclusion of dinner, I agreed to send my friend a list of appropriate questions he could use as a benchmark while interviewing a team only three iterations into adopting Scrum.  I've included that list below.

### Product Owner
- Has the group of ~75 been divided into teams no larger than 10?
- Does each team have a stated purpose, specialty, or area of focus?
- Have specific areas of responsibility been identified for each Team so that the organization knows to which team they should send specific work requests.
- Has a Sprint duration been defined and upheld without special extensions?
- Has a Product Owner been defined for each Team?
- Do Product Owners hold any other role on the Team (developer, tester, etc.)?
- Is the Product Owner working across more than two teams?
- Is the Product Owner collaborating with the Team at least once per week to groom future work?
- Is the Sprint Review open to all members from all Teams and key Stakeholders?
- Has a Definition of Done been adopted by each Team and used in tandem with Acceptance Criteria to determine if work is acceptable at the conclusion of each Sprint?
- Does the Team understand the three potential conclusions of a Sprint?
	- Deliver on full commitment with potentially shippable product
	- Renegotiate commitment with Product Owner no later than halfway through Sprint
	- Abnormal Termination
- Can every Team member articulate that an Abnormal Termination is the result of the Team appearing for a Sprint Review with incomplete work and without having previously communicated the risk of failure to the Product Owner?
- Does every Team member understand that they do not get "partial credit" toward their Velocity for work done in a Sprint that Abnormally Terminates?
- Has a clear policy been established regarding how to address emergent bugs or hot fixes which result in the Team's ability to renegotiate their Sprint commitment?
- Is the Product Owner ensuring that no one from management is attending the Sprint Retrospective?
- Does the Product Owner feel that the Team expects him/her to fully scope work without their collaboration or contribution?
- Are User Story writing workshops being conducted with the Team and Stakeholders to help aid in the process of identifying work?

### Scrum Master
- Has a Scrum Master been defined for each Team?
- Is the Scrum Master working across more than three team?
- Is Velocity being tracked for each Team?
- Is the Scrum Master ensuring that the commitment by the Team is not contingent on the completion of work or delivery of information from outside the Team?
- Are emergent bugs or hot fixes being funneled through the Product Owner for priority consideration instead of being directed directly to the Team?
- Are any tools or documents outside the Product Backlog used to organize, prioritize, or track work?
- Is a Sprint Burndown chart centrally available and maintained daily for all Team members and Stakeholders to review?
- Has a Definition of Ready been adopted by each Team and act as a gatekeeper between the Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog?

### Team
- Does the Team feel they have had a collaborative role in shaping the degree of specificity in the work they are being asked to do?
- At the start of a Sprint, is work full shaped with all needed assets (interfaces, approved copy, etc)?
- Is new work added, work priority dictated, or work scope modified mid-Sprint?
- Does the Team feel as though they are empowered to reject a request to include work in a Sprint due to the work not being ready?

### Ceremonies
- Is the Daily Scrum occurring daily where the Team stands and is time-boxed to 15 minutes?
- Are teams previewing their work during the Sprint Review from a single branch in their source code management tool on a single server environment which mirrors production?
- Are Backlog Grooming meetings happening with the full Team at least twice per Sprint?
- Is Planning Poker being conducted during Backlog Grooming meetings?
- Are User Stories being outlined into Tasks during Sprint Planning?
- Are hour estimates appended to each Task?
- Is the Scrum Master facilitating a formal commitment by the Team on a specific set of work at the conclusion of each Sprint Planning meeting?
- Have all ceremonies been implemented: Daily Scrum, Backlog Grooming, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective?
- Is the Sprint cycle on a solid and predictable schedule where deadlines and expectations are being met without the need for special exceptions?

### Product Backlog
- Is work being defined exclusively on a physical or digital backlog?
- Is work articulated in User Story format?
- Do User Stories contain Acceptance Criteria?
- Do User Stories contain Tasks?
- Do User Stories contain Point estimates?
- Do Tasks contain hour estimates?
- Does the Product Backlog contain a minimum of three Sprints of work at all times?
- Is the top 20% of the Product Backlog fully groomed and meet the Definition of Ready at all times?
