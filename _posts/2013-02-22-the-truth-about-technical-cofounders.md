I just had one of those coffee meetings that was scheduled for one hour and turned into three.  If you are an entrepreneur or someone with a large appetite for risk/reward, you know the kind of first time meet-up I'm talking about.  The kind where ideas just click.  Mutual respect is established quickly, you both discover you see the world from a similar vantage point, and you both care about solving similar problems.   Most significantly, you realize that the person you are talking with has a clear purpose, complimentary skills to yours, and a high likelihood of achieving the goal they are setting out to conquer.  Those meetings are great!  For entrepreneurs, they are everything short of addictive.

But all is not perfect in the land of unicorns and perpetual sunshine.  Really bad decisions are made in these kinds of meetings.  Two very dangerous words lurks on the tongues of entrepreneurial people when they talk about pre-revenue ideas — _co-founder_ and _equity_.  Two eggs, that when cracked, are nearly impossible to unscramble without someone feeling that they've been screwed.

As an entrepreneurial technologist I've had an adequate number of conversations with business entrepreneurs over the years to know when someone is about to offer me a piece of their company.   I got that vibe today.  But then I did something I hadn't premeditated.  It's something I'd encourage others to do too.  I stopped the start-up CEO before he cracked any eggs.  I told him I didn't want to be CTO of his start-up, to partner with him for equity, or options for dividends in his company.  I just want to help him.

### How does a non-technical founder get the help s/he needs to build a web or mobile software product?

There is a growing population of software engineers and technology leaders that are extroverted enough to defy a few dozen negative stereotypes and quickly create meaningful connections within the business crowd.  I call them _Articulate Geeks_.  Although these Articulate Geeks spend a large percentage of their time with _Suits_, they are keen enough to stay connected with their roots and endear themselves to the development community.  They sit between the technical and business realms and hold the keys to building highly capable teams.  They've got just the right amount of grey hair.  They have well-curated LinkedIn profiles. These characteristics send the message to Suits that Articulate Geeks bring proven execution to the table — but don't have so many notches in their belt that they have "I'd rather be golfing" bumper stickers on their Land Rovers.  Suits get oddly mesmerized by the Articulate Geeks' ability to quickly switch between an empathetic pitch of a product's vision to an empirical assessment of an engineering objective.  In short, Suits almost always put Articulate Geeks on pedestals.  The problem emerges when, you guessed it, Suits figure out that Articulate Geeks are human.

The reality is that Articulate Geeks are just as unstable as engineers, as attention deficient as creatives, and as opinionated as marketers.  The Articulate Geeks are fun and inspiring to be around and they know how to produce fast change and meaningful results.  But they are a unique, blended cocktail of mild personality disorders which often produce frustration among those with whom they are peers.  That said, Articulate Geeks are desperately important to success in start-ups.  Ask anyone who has ever worked with me and they'll tell you that I have my own special cocktail of disfunction at play.  That, in combination with my unfounded, unbridled sense of confidence when exploring unfamiliar territory can be a recipe for disaster if left unchecked.  It's impossible to self-diagnose, but my wife points out that it is likely I can describe an Articulate Geek well because I am one.  Hmmm.

I don't mean to single-out Articulate Geeks.  Suits come with their own bag of tricks.  There's enough material on that topic for a separate post, though.

As a non-technical founder of a start-up, you want to find an Articulate Geek.  But you'll need to resist the temptation to go into business with them on day one.


### How do Suits and Articulate Geeks work together successfully?

I've found that building pre-revenue team chemistry is all about the past experience of the founder(s).  I've long believed that people partner in business too early.  When a company is in it's early phases, it's not likely the CEO has figured out how to be a CEO yet — as most start-ups are spear-headed by a first-time CEO.  At later stages in a company's journey I believe that Articulate Geeks and Suits can work together quite well — but within the first year or two of growth an Articulate Geek will likely compete too much with the CEO for authority and cause problems.

Josh Mock once pointed out to me that it's important to understand the distinction between a Stables and Volatiles.  Understanding this distinction is key to building a start-up team.

Articulate Geeks are almost always Volatiles.  A start-up CEO should have at least one Articulate Geek as a lead advisor, and ask him/her to invite a few of their Articulate Geek friends to the table.  Articulate Geeks love to argue with each other as a high form of collaboration.  Give them problems and let them duke-out ideas.  CEO's should remind them it's their job to provide options, not conclusions.  Great CEO's ask Articulate Geeks lots of questions — not challenging their conclusions but seeking understanding and clarity.  Articulate Geeks often love to train and coach.  They will respect a CEO who admits what they don't know and shows an acuity for remembering things which have been explained.

Depending on the nature of the start-up, additional team members such as software engineers can be either Volatiles or Stables.  User Experience experts and Testers should always be Stables.

This model, my friends, is what true __mentorship__ between an Articulate Geek and a Suit looks like. 

For my fellow Nashvilian's, technical mentorship is what many of us set out to offer when we aligned ourselves with the Entrepreneur Center and JumpStart Foundry over the past four years.  What we learned is that a higher value was placed on business planning and preparing founders to raise investment dollars than the development of revenue producing products.  No harm, though.  New opportunity to provide a different flavor of mentorship is actively emerging through institutions like Nashville Software School and the many Hack events popping up all over town.


### Should Articulate Geeks be Early-Stage Co-Founders?

My recommendation to my technical comrades would be to steer enthusiastic conversations away from partnership and toward mentoring.  Yes, you may have successfully read between the lines.  _I do not advocate for Technical Co-Founders in pre-revenue companies._

I anticipate that some might say that a start-up could use-up and toss-out an Articulate Geek who acts as a Mentor without ever incentivizing him/her for their time investment.  Well, yes, that is a risk.  My argument would be that if you can't trust a start-up to incentivize you at a later date, that probably isn't a group of people who you want your name next to in an Operating Agreement.  Partnerships and equity create unnecessarily complex business situations at the pre-revenue stage.

That said, start-up should reserve a block of equity for the eventual hiring for a full time CTO.  When that CTO is hired, their equity position should vest over a 2-3 year period.  The start-up should be prepared to pay 85% of the market rate for a CTO.  The Articulate Geek(s) acting as Mentor(s) through the pre-revenue stage should be at the front of the line for this job.  

If at any point the CEO feels the Articulate Geek(s) acting as Mentor(s) would be an inappropriate fit for the CTO position, they should communicate this to the Articulate Geek immediately and allow them to be released of any advisory responsibility.  However, there isn't any reason the Articulate Geek can't continue to Mentor, with the permission of the CEO, under circumstances where they are not being considered for the CTO position.

__Notice to CEO's: Breaking the above rule is a great way to find yourself on the butt end of an entire city of software engineers.  It would be unwise to string along an Articulate Geek.__


### What should a Suit expect from a Articulate Geek acting as a Mentor?
- S/he won't write code
- S/he can help recruit full time, part time, or contract-based talent
- S/he can implement an estimating and planning methodology to aid in identifying product roadmaps and timelines
- S/he can help define quality standards for UX designers, engineers, and testers
- S/he can provide code review
- S/he can aid in vendor and platform due-diligence, contract negotiation, and selection
- S/he can act as an advocate and reference for potential investors
- S/he can develop architecture, scaling, source code management, network, back-up, monitoring, failover, emergency disaster recovery and other planning exercises

### Conclusion

We all need to remember that most of us will be a part of the Nashville community for a long time.  A decade from now I want the same thing for you that I want for myself — to see a lot of successful businesses in which I lent a helping hand toward.  Some I'll own a part of.  Some I'll make an ongoing advisory contribution to.  Some I'll cheer on from the sidelines.  Others I will have gained the privilege of doing future business with through the act of mentorship in place of partnership.

Keeping pre-revenue business relationships simple is a great way of lowering the probability of you needing to avoid people in the grocery store 10 years from now.
